## 🤖 Agro-Assist ML

Throughout the project, we used various machine learning models to power the platform’s features:

- **Crop Type Recommendation System** – Random Forest Classifier  
- **Fertilizer Recommendation System** – Random Forest Classifier  
- **Crop Disease Identification System** – ResNet18 (CNN)  

### Django API Integration
- The ML models were integrated into Django Apps to generate REST API endpoints.  
- The frontend communicates with these APIs, sending user input data to receive predictions or recommendations in real-time.
